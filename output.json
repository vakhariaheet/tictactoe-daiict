Specific color fills each with a \n4. Models - Digital representations of objects or graphics Scene in 2D or 3D, used in computer for rendering and animations.\n5. Rendering - The process of generating an image from a 3D model by Simulating light interactions to produce visual output\n6. Animation - Creating 'motion by displaying a Sequence of images or frames rapidly, giving the illusion of movement over time","7. Object - A Component within a graphics environment with properties like shape and color, used in Scenes and models\n8. Vertical Retrace - the time taken for a display to return to the Screen's top after completing one frame's display\n9. Horizontal Retrace - the time taken for a display to move back to the start of a line after finishing that line.\nQ.2\n- Cathode Ray Tube\n-> A Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) is an old display technology used in early television sets and computer 'monitors. It consists of a large, vacuum-sealed glass tube with three main components :\n. The Electron Gun\n. The Deflection System \n. Phosphorescent Screen.\n-> Electron Gun: Located at one end of tube. Stream of electrons, these electrons are accelerated and focused into a narrow beam","-> Deflection System: This system uses magnetic or electric fields to direct the electron beam across the screen. It controls the path of the beam, moving it in a raster scan pattern to cover the entire screen.\n-> Phosphorescent Screen : The inner surface of the screen is coated with phosphor materials that emit light when struck by the electron beam. The screen is divided into tiny segments or pixels, each emitting different colors when triggered by the electron. \nARCHITECTURE OF CATHODE RAY TUBE (CRT)","Q.3 Differentiate between Raster Graphics and vector Graphics\n-> Raster Graphic Vector Graphics\n. They are composed of pixels . They are composed of paths.\n. In Raster Graphics, refresh . Vector displays flicker process is independent of the complexity of when the number of primitives in the the image image become too large\n. Graphic primitives are .

Raster Graphics can draw . vector graphics draw mathematical curves, polygons and boundaries of curved polygons only by pixel approximation\n. They occupy more space . They occupy comparatively less space \n. File ext. BMP, GIF, JPEG . File ext.: SVG, PDF, AI, EPS","Q.4 Architecture of Random Scan System:\n-> A random Scan System, also known as Vector display, constructs images by directing an electron beam to draw directly on the Screen. This approach contrasts with raster Scan Systems, which Systematically cover the Screen line by line.\nkey Components: \n. Electron Gun : Generates and focuses an electron beam. It moves the beam to specific screen location based on given coordinates, rather than following a repetitive pattern.\n. Deflection Mechanism: Adjusts the beam's path with high accuracy. This System can be either magnetic or electrostatic, enabling precise movement to trace out lines and shapes\n. Phosphorescent Screen: Covered with phosphor that glow when struck by the electron beam. This glowing creates visible lines and shapes as the beam moves.","How it works?\n-> The System uses coordinates to determine where the beam should move. The deflection mechanisms guide the beam to these coordinates to draw the image. This method excels in rendering precise lines and curves but may be slower for complex graphics Compared to Raster display.\nQ.5 Architecture of Raster Scan System\n-> A raster Scan display is the most prevalent type found in CRT televisions and monitors. In this system, an electron beam is moved across the screen in a sweeping motion, Covering one row at a time. It moves across each row as its intensity is modulated to produce a pattern of illuminated Spots, creating the image. \n-> It Comprises of a CPU equipped with a specialized video controller that manages the display operations. The System includes a frame buffer, which temporarily stores the image data that","needs to be shown on the monitor. The video controller accesses this frame buffer to refresh the screen continually by updating the frame buffer and controlling the beam's intensity. This setup enables System efficiently displays complex images and video content. the raster Scan ensures that the screen is updated accurately and regularly.\nQ.6 Differentiate between Raster Scan System & Vector Scan System:\n-> Raster Scan System Vector Scan System\n. Beam moved between all . Beam moves between lines at a time, one scan the end points of over the Screen from top to graphics primitives. bottom and then back to top\n. The refresh process is . It flickers when the independent of the number of primitives in complexity of image buffer too large.\n. Graphic primitives are specified . Scan conversion is not in terms of their end points required (HW). and must be scan converted into corresponding pixels in the buffer.",". It can display mathematically .

It has ability to display . Draws only points, areas filled with lines and characters. solid colors/ patterns.\n. Low Resolution. . High Resolution.\nQ.7 Applications of Computer Graphics\n-> Some of prominent applications of computer graphics are as below:\n. Entertainment - used in creating realistic visual effects and animations for movies. Essential for developing video games and virtual reality experiences.\n. Design Industry - Facilitates 2D and 3D modeling and design for product design, architectural visualization, and fashion design. Enhances creative workflow","and design accuracy.\n.
